Best Practices
Use Modern C# Features: Target the latest .NET version (e.g. .NET 7 or 8) and use modern language features and APIs. Prefer newer constructs (like LINQ for collection handling, async/await for concurrency) over legacy approaches
learn.microsoft.com
. Avoid outdated patterns (e.g. ArrayList or old WebClient) when better alternatives exist (generic collections, HttpClient). Enable nullable reference types in project settings to catch null-related bugs early.
Coding Style and Conventions: Follow Microsoft’s .NET naming conventions: use PascalCase for class, property, and method names; camelCase for local variables and parameters; ALL_CAPS for constants. Keep methods focused and small – a method should ideally do one thing (adhering to SRP). Use expression-bodied members for simple get-only properties or short methods to reduce boilerplate. When an object implements IDisposable, use the using statement or await using (for IAsyncDisposable) to ensure timely disposal of unmanaged resources.
SOLID and OOP Design: Apply SOLID principles in class design. For example, Single Responsibility Principle – each class or method should have one job. Open/Closed Principle – design for extension without modifying existing code (use abstraction, interfaces). Use interfaces and dependency injection for decoupling; instead of directly instantiating classes inside classes, inject abstractions (this improves testability and maintainability). Embrace immutability for value objects (make them readonly or use record types) to avoid unintended side-effects.
Linting and Formatting
Static Analyzers and StyleCop: Use .NET analyzers or StyleCop to enforce naming and style conventions. The .NET SDK includes many CA and IDE analyzer rules – enable them (treat warnings as errors for critical rules) to catch issues like unused variables or hidden bugs. Maintain an .editorconfig for consistent code style (indents, spacing, etc.) across the team
learn.microsoft.com
. These tools will ensure consistency (e.g. spacing around operators, bracing style) without relying on manual code review comments.
Consistent Formatting: Utilize Visual Studio or Rider formatting rules – e.g. 4 spaces indentation, braces on new lines (Allman style) as per default conventions. Use auto-format on save to enforce these. Organize using directives (System namespaces first, etc.) – most IDEs can sort/remove unused usings on save. Ensure files end with a newline and there’s no trailing whitespace. Running dotnet format as part of CI can automatically fix formatting issues.
Meaningful Naming & Comments: Linters should ensure naming rules (e.g. interfaces start with I, async methods end in “Async”). Name variables clearly – e.g. customerRepository instead of cr. Avoid abbreviations that reduce clarity. Comment your code sparingly but effectively: XML documentation comments on public APIs (for IntelliSense) are encouraged for libraries. Internally, prefer self-documenting code over excessive comments (refactor confusing code rather than writing a comment explaining it).
Architecture and Structure
Layered Architecture: Separate your code into logical layers or projects – e.g. Domain (business logic, entities), Application/Service (use cases, orchestration), Infrastructure (data access, external integrations), UI (Web, desktop, or API controllers). This clear separation (often called Clean Architecture or Onion Architecture) makes the codebase more maintainable and testable. Use interfaces to abstract between layers (for example, define repository interfaces in the domain layer, implement them in the infrastructure layer).
MVVM / MVC Patterns: Follow established patterns for the app type. In desktop applications (WPF, MAUI, Xamarin), use MVVM – keep Views (XAML) free of logic by binding to ViewModel properties and commands. In ASP.NET Core web apps, apply MVC or Razor Pages patterns – controllers (or pages) handle HTTP and delegate to services for business logic. Ensure that business logic is not tightly coupled to UI or data layers (use dependency injection to supply required services).
Dependency Injection and Configuration: Use the built-in DI container in .NET to inject services – register services (transient or singleton as appropriate) in Program.cs or Startup. This promotes loose coupling and easier testing (you can swap implementations, or use mocks in tests). Favor configuring through appsettings or environment variables rather than hardcoding values; use IOptions<T> pattern for groups of settings. Structuring configuration and services this way leads to more modular and flexible architecture.
Modern Tooling
Latest .NET and Libraries: Stay up-to-date with the .NET platform improvements – for example, .NET 6/7’s minimal APIs or improved performance. Use NuGet packages for common needs instead of custom coding (e.g. Serilog for logging, FluentValidation for input validation, MediatR for CQRS/messaging between layers). Employ source generators or Roslyn analyzers for repetitive code tasks (e.g. INotifyPropertyChanged implementations via Fody or source generators). Modern C# features like pattern matching, records, Span<T>/Memory<T> for performance are there – use them appropriately to write succinct and efficient code.
IDE and CI Integration: Take advantage of Visual Studio/Rider productivity tools – refactorings, analyzers, code fixes. Enable Nullable Reference Types and treat warnings as errors for robust code. For large solutions, consider using EditorConfig to enforce settings and dotnet-format in CI. Use tools like SonarQube or Roslyn analyzers to continuously inspect code quality and technical debt. Modern .NET tooling can also generate boilerplate: e.g., use dotnet new templates for consistent project setup and dotnet tools (like dotnet-outdated) to manage package updates.
Performance and Profiling Tools: In performance-sensitive applications, use profilers (dotTrace, VS Profiler) to find bottlenecks, and apply modern optimizations: e.g., use async IO to free threads, use ValueTask or pooling if necessary for high-frequency call paths, span-based processing for large text or binary handling, etc. Use benchmarking (Benchmark.NET) to compare approaches when optimizing critical sections. Modern .NET is very fast; combine that with efficient algorithms and you get great performance out of the box.
Security, Testing, Performance, and DX
Security Practices: Handle sensitive data with care – never store secrets or passwords in code or config in plain text. Use the SecureString/PasswordVault or Azure Key Vault integration for secrets management. Validate all inputs, especially if building web APIs (use model validation attributes or FluentValidation). When catching exceptions, catch specific exceptions instead of swallowing all (catch(Exception)) to avoid hiding issues
learn.microsoft.com
. Keep software updated – apply updates to NuGet packages and .NET runtime to get security fixes. If the application is web-facing, follow ASP.NET security best practices (e.g. use HTTPS, set up proper CORS, anti-forgery tokens for forms, etc.).
Testing: Write automated tests for business logic and critical components. Use xUnit or NUnit for unit tests and MSTest or FluentAssertions as needed to make assertions expressive. Aim for high coverage on core libraries (business logic, util functions). Use dependency injection to swap out real dependencies for fakes/mocks in tests (e.g. inject an in-memory repository or use mocking frameworks like Moq). Incorporate integration tests for data access (using an in-memory database or test containers for SQL) to verify that the system works end-to-end. Run tests in CI and consider code coverage tools to identify untested paths.
Performance Considerations: Be mindful of memory and CPU in critical paths. Use appropriate data structures (e.g. use List<T> or Array for large collections rather than non-generic collections; use dictionaries for fast lookups). Avoid unnecessary allocations – for example, prefer using StringBuilder for large string concatenations, or use Span<T> to operate on substrings without allocations. Dispose of IDisposable resources promptly to free native resources (use the using pattern or implement the dispose pattern correctly for your classes). If running asynchronous code, avoid blocking calls (no .Result or .Wait() on tasks) to prevent thread pool starvation – use await all the way. Regularly measure with profilers or benchmarks if performance is a key requirement.
Developer Experience: Ensure the solution is easy to work with: organize projects logically and use solution folders if needed. Provide a clear README for the repository with setup instructions and common commands (building, testing, running). Leverage analyzers to give instant feedback in IDE (e.g. code style suggestions, Roslyn analyzer warnings) – this reduces PR churn. Use Git hooks or CI checks to enforce formatting and pass tests before merge. For long-running builds, consider using incremental builds or splitting into smaller solutions for daily work. Embrace the rich .NET community tools – for example, use Live Unit Testing in Visual Studio for immediate test feedback, and consider using Hot Reload for GUI projects to see changes without full rebuild. All these improve developer productivity and code quality.
