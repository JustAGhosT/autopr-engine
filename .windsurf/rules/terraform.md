Best Practices
Code Organization: Structure Terraform code into logical modules. Use root module to glue things together and create reusable modules for common patterns (e.g. VPC, database, server group) rather than one giant configuration. This makes code easier to navigate and promotes reuse across environments. Place related resources in the same file or folder, and use clear naming (e.g. networking/vpc.tf, compute/instances.tf). Keep Terraform code DRY by using loops (count, for_each) or modules instead of duplicating blocks.
State Management: Use remote backend for Terraform state (e.g. Azure Storage, S3 + DynamoDB lock, Terraform Cloud) instead of local state files, especially in team environments. This ensures state is persisted, shared, and locked to prevent concurrent runs. Protect the state (enable encryption at rest, use limited-access backend credentials) since it may contain sensitive info. Use terraform workspaces or separate state files for isolating environments (e.g. staging vs prod) rather than a single state for everything.
Version Control & Version Pinning: Commit your Terraform code and module code to version control. Pin provider versions in the configuration (in required_providers) and Terraform version in required_version

 using pessimistic constraints (like ~> 3.52 for AWS provider) to avoid unexpected upgrades breaking your code. Do the same for module sources (if using public registry modules, specify version = "x.y.z"). When upgrading Terraform or providers, review the release notes for breaking changes.
Linting and Formatting
Terraform Fmt: Always run terraform fmt on your code before check-in (or enable your editor to do so on save). This enforces the canonical style: 2-space indents, consistent alignment of = signs, newlines between blocks, etc.

. Proper formatting makes diffs cleaner and the code easier to read for everyone. Make it part of CI to reject improperly formatted code (the command can be run in check mode).
TFLint and Checkov: Use TFLint to catch common issues and enforce additional rules

. TFLint can warn about deprecated syntax, potential mistakes (like using aws_instance without a key_name on AWS), and even policy checks. For security and compliance, integrate Checkov or tfsec, which statically analyze Terraform for security risks (like open security groups, unencrypted disks). These tools help maintain best practices beyond just style – for example, they’ll flag if you accidentally leave an S3 bucket public.
Style Guide Conventions: Adhere to a consistent style in naming and structure: use lowercase with underscores for resource names and Terraform variables (e.g. resource "aws_instance" "app_server" – the resource name app_server is lowercase and underscores)
developer.hashicorp.com
. Do not include the provider or type in the resource name (since the resource block already indicates the type)

. Name Terraform variables clearly (e.g. instance_count instead of count to avoid shadowing). Provide descriptions for variables and outputs for clarity

. Group related configuration – for instance, keep all variables in a variables.tf and outputs in outputs.tf to standardize layout. Keeping a tidy and convention-driven repo makes it easier for contributors to find things and understand the configuration.
Architecture and Structure
Logical Separation: Separate different concerns into different Terraform configurations or workspaces. For example, manage core infrastructure (network, IAM) in one config and application-specific infrastructure in another, if they have different lifecycles. This prevents accidental changes to core infra when deploying apps. Use Terraform workspaces or separate state files to isolate stages (dev/staging/prod) – don't use a single state for all environments, to avoid cross-impact.
Module Usage: Use modules for grouping resources that form a logical unit (e.g., a module for a web service that includes an autoscaling group, load balancer, and associated security groups). Define module inputs and outputs clearly so that the module is black-box reusable. For internal modules, version them (even if just via Git SHA or a registry) so changes are tracked. Within modules, follow standard structure: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf for clarity. Modules not only promote reuse but also make large configs more manageable by abstracting details.
State and Dependency Management: Be mindful of implicit dependencies. Terraform generally figures out resource order by references, but in cases where it cannot (or to make it explicit), use depends_on. However, prefer using outputs and interpolations to create implicit dependencies rather than adding many manual depends_on. Avoid data races like one resource reading data from another resource’s API (use Terraform data sources carefully and understand that could cause refresh cycles). If using remote data (data sources), know that if those resources change out of band, Terraform might not notice unless you refresh. For critical external dependencies, consider importing them as managed resources (if you’re allowed) or have documentation on how they’re managed.
Modern Tooling
Terraform Version and Features: Keep up with Terraform improvements. Terraform 1.x has added features like preconditions/postconditions for resource validation

 and the import block for importing existing resources into state. Use these features to your advantage – e.g., add a precondition to ensure a variable meets some criteria (like Azure location is within allowed list) to catch errors early. Use moved blocks (in 1.x) to refactor/rename resources without destroying them. Keep Terraform updated to a stable recent release to get bug fixes and enhancements (but avoid cutting-edge releases in prod without testing).
Tooling Ecosystem: Consider using tools like Terragrunt if you have many environments and want to reduce code duplication – Terragrunt can generate Terraform config from live directories and manage backend configs per env. If you prefer not to introduce Terragrunt, ensure your own structure is DRY (perhaps use partial configurations or scripts to generate configs for similar envs). Utilize terraform validate in CI to catch errors before apply
developer.hashicorp.com
. Use tfsec/Checkov (as mentioned) in pipelines to enforce security. For complex changes, terraform’s plan output can be hard to read – consider using the human-readable diff tools or the JSON plan output with automation to detect significant changes (there are community tools that comment on PRs with plan summaries).
State Insights and Backup: Use terraform show and terraform state list to inspect state when needed. Regularly backup your state (if remote, ensure the storage has versioning). Should something go wrong (e.g., state corruption or accidental resource deletion in cloud), having backups and understanding of state can be a lifesaver. Modern backends (Terraform Cloud, etc.) have state history – leverage that if available. Also, use the state locking mechanism (most backends have it) – it prevents concurrent runs which could corrupt state. If you integrate with CI, configure it such that only one apply can run at a time against a given state (or use Terraform Cloud/Enterprise which handles a queue).
Security, Testing, Performance, and DX
Security: Never commit secrets into Terraform files or variable files. Use Terraform’s sensitive variables for things like passwords or keys (marking output as sensitive = true to avoid printing to console)
developer.hashicorp.com
. Leverage cloud provider’s secret stores (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) by retrieving secrets at runtime via data sources or integrating with provisioning (better than having them in plaintext in TF vars). Implement guardrails: for example, if deploying security groups, default to least privilege (no wide-open 0.0.0.0/0 unless explicitly intended). If possible, run terraform plan/apply in a controlled environment (CI) with restricted credentials that only have access to needed resources – this reduces blast radius if the credentials are compromised.
Testing Infrastructure as Code: While Terraform doesn’t have a built-in testing framework, you can implement testing by writing scripts that do terraform plan and parse the output for unexpected changes. Consider using Terratest (a Go library) to programmatically deploy a Terraform stack to a test environment and then assert on the infrastructure (for example, check if an AWS EC2 instance is actually running via AWS SDK). At minimum, always do a manual review of the terraform plan output before applying in production and possibly have a peer review it as well (e.g., require approval on a pull request that includes the plan output). This human-in-the-loop catches mistakes that automated lint might not (like accidentally destroying a DB instance).
Performance: Terraform’s performance mostly concerns how quickly it can plan and apply. Keep the number of resources in a single state reasonable – thousands of resources in one plan can slow down operations and increase the chance of timeouts. If you hit performance issues, break configurations into modules or separate states. Use the -parallelism flag (with care) to increase concurrent resource provisioning if your environment can handle it – by default Terraform applies up to 10 resources in parallel. Ensure you’re not doing superfluous work: e.g., avoid null_resource and local-exec hacks that run every apply unless absolutely needed (they can be slow and often there are better IaC-native ways).
Developer Experience: Make it easy to work with Terraform for your team. Provide README documentation for each module explaining inputs/outputs and usage. Use descriptive variable names and defaults that make sense (and mention units/currency in the var description if relevant). When someone new looks at the code, clear structure and comments help them ramp up. Use consistent ordering in resource blocks (Terraform fmt does some of this) – e.g., first provider, then resource type and name, then properties with tags last – small consistency touches reduce cognitive load. If you leverage IDE tools (VS Code Terraform extension, JetBrains HCL plugin), those can provide completion and highlight errors as you type – encourage their use. Finally, treat Terraform code reviews like application code reviews: check for correctness, clarity, and adherence to best practices. This fosters a culture where infrastructure is code, subject to the same quality controls as application code.
