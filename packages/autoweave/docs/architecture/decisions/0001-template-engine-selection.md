# ADR 0001: Template Engine Selection

## Status
âœ… Accepted

## Context
We need to select a template language and structure for AutoWeave's template system that balances power, familiarity, and maintainability. The template engine will be used across multiple components including the CI/CD pipeline, CLI, and web UI.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-file template system using:
1. **Template Language**: Jinja2-style syntax (via Scriban)
2. **Metadata Format**: YAML
3. **Structure**: Multi-file template packages

## Rationale
1. **Jinja2/Scriban** offers the best balance of power and familiarity:
    - Supports complex logic, loops, and conditionals
    - Familiar to DevOps and platform engineers
    - Good performance characteristics
    - Strong .NET support through Scriban

2. **YAML** was chosen over JSON for metadata because:
    - More readable and writable by humans
    - Better support for comments
    - Widely used in DevOps tools (Kubernetes, Ansible, etc.)
    - Good tooling support in .NET

3. **Multi-file structure** was selected because:
    - Better organization of complex templates
    - Easier maintenance and version control
    - Supports separation of concerns
    - Enables partial templates and reuse

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Familiarity**: Uses technologies well-known in the target audience
- **Power**: Handles complex templating scenarios
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and integrations
- **Tooling**: Good IDE support and syntax highlighting

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: More complex than simpler alternatives like Handlebars
- **Performance**: Slightly more overhead than lighter alternatives
- **Security**: Requires careful sandboxing of template execution
- **Dependencies**: Adds external dependencies (Scriban, YamlDotNet)

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Handlebars/Mustache
**Pros**:
- Simpler to learn
- Logic-less (prevents complex logic in templates)
- Better performance for simple cases

**Cons**:
- Too limited for complex scenarios
- Would require workarounds for common patterns
- Less familiar to target audience

### 2. Go Templates
**Pros**:
- Popular in cloud-native ecosystem
- Strong typing
- Good performance

**Cons**:
- Less common in .NET ecosystem
- More verbose syntax
- Smaller community than Jinja2

### 3. Custom DSL
**Pros**:
- Perfect fit for exact requirements
- No external dependencies

**Cons**:
- High maintenance cost
- Steeper learning curve
- Limited tooling
- No community support

## Implementation Notes
- Use Scriban as the template engine
- Implement strict sandboxing for security
- Add validation for template metadata
- Include comprehensive error messages
- Provide clear documentation and examples
