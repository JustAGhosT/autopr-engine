## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


AutoPR implements an AI-powered code analysis and enhancement system with several key business domains:

1. AI Linting and Code Fixing Engine
- Core system for automated code improvement using AI agents
- Multi-stage workflow: detection → analysis → fix generation → validation
- Specialized agent selection based on issue types
- Domain-specific confidence scoring for fix validation
File: autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/ai_linting_fixer.py

2. Quality Control System
- Volume-based quality control (0-1000 scale)
- Maps volume levels to operational modes:
  * 0-199: Ultra-fast mode
  * 200-399: Fast mode
  * 400-599: Smart mode
  * 600-799: Comprehensive mode
  * 800-1000: AI-enhanced mode
File: autopr/actions/quality_engine/volume_mapping.py

3. Platform Detection and Enhancement
- Identifies development platforms through weighted scoring
- Generates platform-specific enhancements:
  * Testing infrastructure
  * Security hardening
  * Production readiness
File: autopr/actions/platform_detection/detector.py

4. Memory and Learning System
- Pattern recognition from historical fixes
- Success rate tracking per issue type
- AI agent performance optimization
File: autopr/actions/learning_memory_system.py

Core Integration Points:
1. AI Provider Management
- Multi-provider fallback system
- Provider-specific confidence scoring
- Load balancing and quota management
File: autopr/actions/llm/manager.py

2. Security Authorization Framework
- Resource-based access control
- Zero-trust security model
- Progressive lockout system
File: autopr/security/authorization/enterprise_manager.py

3. Quality Analytics Engine
- Success rate analysis
- Fix confidence tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring
File: autopr/quality/metrics_collector.py

The system integrates these components through a workflow orchestration layer that coordinates between AI agents, quality controls, and platform-specific enhancements while maintaining comprehensive security and performance tracking.
