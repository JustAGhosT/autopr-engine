## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The AutoPR Engine implements an AI-powered code quality and review system with several key business components:

## AI Linting and Code Quality
The core linting system uses specialized AI agents to detect and fix code issues:

- Custom agent selection based on issue types and historical success rates
- Confidence scoring system for automated fixes (0.3-0.9 range)
- Multi-step validation pipeline with syntax checking and regression detection
- Progressive retry logic with configurable thresholds
- Performance tracking with fix success analytics

File paths:
```
autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/agents.py
autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/workflow.py
```

## Platform Detection Engine 
Implements sophisticated platform fingerprinting:

- Multi-signal detection using file patterns, dependencies, and commit history
- Weighted scoring algorithm for platform confidence (0-1.0)
- Migration opportunity analysis between platforms
- Hybrid workflow detection for multi-platform setups

File paths:
```
autopr/actions/platform_detection/detector.py
autopr/actions/platform_detection/scoring.py
```

## Quality Analysis System
Comprehensive code quality assessment:

- Multiple analysis modes (FAST, COMPREHENSIVE, AI_ENHANCED)
- Custom severity classification for issues
- Platform-specific tool substitution for Windows compatibility
- AI-enhanced code review with specialized agents
- Success rate tracking and confidence scoring

File paths:
```
autopr/actions/quality_engine/engine.py
autopr/actions/quality_engine/ai/ai_analyzer.py
```

## Volume Control System
Unique approach to managing development tool strictness:

- HiFi-style volume control (0-1000) for linting intensity
- Separate dev and commit volume knobs
- Progressive tool activation based on volume levels
- Platform-specific configuration management

File paths:
```
scripts/volume-control/volume_knob.py
scripts/volume-control/json_migrations.py
```

## Implementation Roadmap System
Manages phased implementation of software enhancements:

- Multi-agent collaboration for code improvements
- Phase-based execution with dependency tracking
- Custom health scoring for implementation progress
- AI-driven recommendations for improvements

File paths:
```
autopr/extensions/implementation/phase_manager.py
autopr/extensions/implementation/task_executor.py
```

The system's core value lies in its AI-powered approach to code quality improvement, with sophisticated orchestration of multiple specialized components working together to analyze and enhance code quality.
