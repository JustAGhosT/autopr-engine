## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


AutoPR Engine implements a sophisticated AI-powered code quality and enhancement system with several key business components:

1. AI Linting & Code Fixing
- Specialized AI agents handle different code issues (imports, line length, variables)
- Custom confidence scoring (0.4-0.9) based on fix complexity and issue type
- Progressive retry logic with intelligent fallback mechanisms
- File Path: autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/agents.py

2. Platform Detection System  
- Multi-factor platform detection using weighted evidence
- Custom scoring for platform confidence based on files, dependencies, and patterns
- Migration recommendation engine for platform transitions
- File Path: autopr/actions/platform_detection/detector.py

3. Quality Control Framework
- HiFi-style volume control (0-1000) for adjusting validation strictness
- Four distinct quality modes: fast, comprehensive, AI-enhanced, smart
- Platform-specific tool substitution and adaptation
- File Path: autopr/actions/quality_engine/engine.py

4. Multi-Agent Code Analysis
- Specialized AI roles: Code Analyzer, Fixer, Reviewer, Security Auditor
- Custom consensus building through agent conversations 
- Learning system adapts from PR feedback and historical performance
- File Path: autopr/extensions/implementation/implementor.py

5. Security & Authorization 
- Zero-trust model with context-aware validation
- Role-based permissions with granular resource control
- Custom audit logging for authorization decisions
- File Path: autopr/security/authorization/models.py

The system orchestrates these components through:
- Event-driven workflow engine
- Multi-provider LLM integration with fallback chains
- Platform-specific enhancement strategies
- Quality gate decision logic

Core workflows connect through:
- Issue detection -> AI agent selection -> Fix validation -> Quality gates
- Platform detection -> Enhancement strategy -> Implementation workflow
- Quality analysis -> Agent review -> Consensus building -> Automated fixes

File paths containing critical business logic:
- autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/
- autopr/actions/platform_detection/
- autopr/actions/quality_engine/
- autopr/security/authorization/
- autopr/extensions/implementation/
