# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
# Main Overview
## Development Guidelines
- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
The AutoPR Engine implements an AI-powered code quality and review system with several key business components:
## AI Linting and Code Quality
The core linting system uses specialized AI agents to detect and fix code issues:
- Custom agent selection based on issue types and historical success rates
- Confidence scoring system for automated fixes (0.3-0.9 range)
- Multi-step validation pipeline with syntax checking and regression detection
- Progressive retry logic with configurable thresholds
- Performance tracking with fix success analytics
File paths:
```python
autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/agents.py
autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/workflow.py
```
## Platform Detection Engine
Implements sophisticated platform fingerprinting:
- Multi-signal detection using file patterns, dependencies, and commit history
- Weighted scoring algorithm for platform confidence (0-1.0)
- Migration opportunity analysis between platforms
- Hybrid workflow detection for multi-platform setups
File paths:
```python
autopr/actions/platform_detection/detector.py
autopr/actions/platform_detection/scoring.py
```
## Quality Analysis System
Comprehensive code quality assessment:
- Multiple analysis modes (FAST, COMPREHENSIVE, AI_ENHANCED)
- Custom severity classification for issues
- Platform-specific tool substitution for Windows compatibility
- AI-enhanced code review with specialized agents
- Success rate tracking and confidence scoring
File paths:
```python
autopr/actions/quality_engine/engine.py
autopr/actions/quality_engine/ai/ai_analyzer.py
```
## Volume Control System
Unique approach to managing development tool strictness:
- HiFi-style volume control (0-1000) for linting intensity
- Separate dev and commit volume knobs
- Progressive tool activation based on volume levels
- Platform-specific configuration management
File paths:
```python
scripts/volume-control/volume_knob.py
scripts/volume-control/json_migrations.py
```
## Implementation Roadmap System
Manages phased implementation of software enhancements:
- Multi-agent collaboration for code improvements
- Phase-based execution with dependency tracking
- Custom health scoring for implementation progress
- AI-driven recommendations for improvements
File paths:
```python
autopr/extensions/implementation/phase_manager.py
autopr/extensions/implementation/task_executor.py
```
The system's core value lies in its AI-powered approach to code quality improvement, with sophisticated orchestration of multiple specialized components working together to analyze and enhance code quality.

Volume-Based Quality Control Framework
Importance Score: 85/100

Core Components:

1. Analysis Volume Control
- Granular control system mapping 0-1000 scale to quality depth
- Progressive feature activation based on volume thresholds:
  * 0-200: Basic syntax validation
  * 201-400: Standard checks
  * 401-600: Enhanced validation 
  * 601-800: Comprehensive analysis
  * 801-1000: AI-enhanced review

2. Platform Detection System
- Dynamic technology stack identification
- Framework compatibility analysis
- Multi-factor confidence scoring for platform detection
- Component relationship mapping

3. Quality Gates Engine 
- Multi-stage validation pipeline with weighted metrics
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on project patterns
- Category-specific scoring with configurable weights
- Normalized penalty calculations by check type

4. Learning Memory System
- Pattern recognition for code fixes and user preferences
- Success rate tracking by fix category
- Historical analysis of project conventions
- Context preservation across PR reviews

5. Enterprise Authorization
- Resource-based permission hierarchy
- Dynamic permission inheritance
- Custom role aggregation for code analysis
- Resource ownership tracking

Integration Points:
- Volume control dictates tool activation and depth
- Platform detection informs quality rule selection
- Memory system provides historical context for decisions
- Authorization system gates feature access

The system implements a sophisticated approach to code quality management through volume-based control and intelligent platform detection, with strong emphasis on learning from historical patterns and maintaining proper access control.
