development_approach:
  method: "vibe_coding"
  philosophy:
    "Human-AI collaboration where you control architecture and quality while AI handles repetitive
    coding tasks"
  description:
    "Transform ideas into functioning web apps using conversational prompts instead of manual coding"
  core_principles:
    - "Natural language to code conversion"
    - "Intent-focused development over syntax mastery"
    - "Conversational refinement and iteration"
    - "AI-assisted gap filling and error correction"
    - "Single-platform workflow integration"

  vibe_coding_workflow:
    - "Conceptualize: Define your app vision and core functionality"
    - "Prompt: Use natural language, voice, or image commands"
    - "Collaborate: Guide and refine AI suggestions through conversation"
    - "Iterate: Send feedback prompts for improvements and bug fixes"
    - "Validate: Test functionality and user experience"
    - "Deploy: One-click publishing with integrated hosting"

  prompt_engineering_tips:
    - "Be specific about functionality and user experience"
    - "Describe the 'why' behind features, not just the 'what'"
    - "Use conversational language - explain like talking to a developer"
    - "Iterate incrementally - build and refine step by step"
    - "Leverage voice commands for faster input"
    - "Use image references for design inspiration"
