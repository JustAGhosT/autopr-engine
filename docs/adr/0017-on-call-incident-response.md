# 17. On-Call and Incident Response

## Status
Proposed

## Context
AutoPR requires a robust on-call and incident response process to ensure:
- High availability and reliability
- Rapid detection and resolution of issues
- Clear communication during incidents
- Continuous improvement through post-mortems
- Minimal impact on users and customers

## Decision
We will implement the following on-call and incident response strategy:

### 1. On-Call Rotation

#### 1.1 Primary and Secondary Roles
- **Primary On-Call**: First responder for all incidents
- **Secondary On-Call**: Backup for the primary, assists with critical issues
- **Rotation Schedule**: Weekly rotation with handoff meetings
- **Time Zone Coverage**: Ensure 24/7 coverage for critical services

#### 1.2 On-Call Responsibilities
- Monitor alerts and respond to incidents
- Triage and escalate issues as needed
- Maintain incident documentation
- Participate in post-mortems
- Hand off unresolved issues to the next shift

### 2. Incident Response Process

#### 2.1 Incident Classification
- **Severity 1 (Critical)**: Complete service outage
- **Severity 2 (High)**: Major functionality impacted
- **Severity 3 (Moderate)**: Minor issues with workarounds
- **Severity 4 (Low)**: Cosmetic or non-critical issues

#### 2.2 Incident Command System
- **Incident Commander**: Leads the incident response
- **Communications Lead**: Handles internal/external updates
- **Operations Lead**: Coordinates technical response
- **Scribe**: Documents all actions and decisions

### 3. Tooling and Automation

#### 3.1 Alerting and Monitoring
- **PagerDuty**: For on-call scheduling and alerting
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: For metrics and dashboards
- **Sentry**: For error tracking and monitoring
- **Statuspage**: For service status updates

#### 3.2 Incident Management
- **Incident.io**: For incident tracking and response
- **Slack**: For real-time communication
- **Zoom**: For war room video calls
- **Runbooks**: For common incident procedures

### 4. Communication Plan

#### 4.1 Internal Communication
- **Slack**: #incidents channel for real-time updates
- **Email**: For non-urgent updates and summaries
- **Post-Mortems**: Documented in Confluence

#### 4.2 External Communication
- **Status Page**: Real-time service status
- **Twitter**: For major incident updates
- **Email**: For customer notifications
- **Support Portal**: For ongoing issue tracking

### 5. Post-Incident Process

#### 5.1 Blameless Post-Mortem
- **Timeline**: Document the incident timeline
- **Root Cause**: Identify the underlying cause
- **Impact**: Assess the business and customer impact
- **Action Items**: Define follow-up tasks
- **Lessons Learned**: Document key takeaways

#### 5.2 Continuous Improvement
- **Action Item Tracking**: Jira tickets for all follow-ups
- **Process Updates**: Update runbooks and documentation
- **Training**: Conduct incident response drills
- **Metrics**: Track MTTR, MTBF, and other KPIs

## Consequences
- **Improved Reliability**: Faster resolution of incidents
- **Better Communication**: Clearer stakeholder updates
- **Learning Culture**: Blameless post-mortems
- **Process Refinement**: Continuous improvement
- **Resource Intensive**: Requires dedicated effort

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up on-call rotation and tooling
2. Document incident response procedures
3. Train team members on the process
4. Conduct practice drills
5. Continuously improve based on feedback

## Monitoring and Metrics
- Time to detect (TTD)
- Time to acknowledge (TTA)
- Time to resolve (TTR)
- Number of incidents by severity
- Post-mortem action item completion rate
