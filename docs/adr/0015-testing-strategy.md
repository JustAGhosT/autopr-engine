# 15. Testing Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
AutoPR requires a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure:
- Code quality and reliability
- Prevention of regressions
- Documentation of expected behavior
- Confidence in continuous deployment
- Efficient developer workflow

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered testing strategy with the following components:

### 1. Test Pyramid Implementation

#### 1.1 Unit Tests (60%)
- **Scope**: Individual functions and classes
- **Framework**: pytest
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+ line coverage
- **Mocking**: unittest.mock or pytest-mock for external dependencies
- **Speed**: Sub-second test suite execution

```python
# Example unit test with pytest
def test_parse_github_event():
    # Arrange
    event_data = {"action": "opened", "pull_request": {"number": 123}}

    # Act
    result = parse_github_event(event_data)

    # Assert
    assert result.pr_number == 123
    assert result.action == "opened"
```

#### 1.2 Integration Tests (30%)
- **Scope**: Component interactions
- **Framework**: pytest with fixtures
- **Focus**: API endpoints, database operations, external service integrations
- **Data Management**: Factory Boy for test data
- **Isolation**: Test containers for dependencies

#### 1.3 End-to-End Tests (10%)
- **Scope**: Complete user flows
- **Framework**: Playwright for browser automation
- **Focus**: Critical user journeys
- **Environment**: Staging-like environment
- **Data**: Seeded test data

### 2. Test Automation

#### 2.1 CI/CD Pipeline
- **Unit Tests**: Run on every push
- **Integration Tests**: Run on pull requests
- **E2E Tests**: Run on merge to main
- **Performance Tests**: Scheduled daily

#### 2.2 Test Data Management
- **Factories**: Reusable test data factories
- **Fixtures**: Database state setup/teardown
- **Snapshots**: For complex output verification

### 3. Quality Gates

#### 3.1 Code Coverage
- Minimum 80% line coverage
- PRs blocked if coverage decreases
- Coverage reports in CI

#### 3.2 Static Analysis
- Type checking with mypy
- Code style with Black and isort
- Security scanning with Bandit
- Dependency checking with safety

### 4. Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Locust for API endpoints
- **Stress Testing**: Identify breaking points
- **Baseline Metrics**: Track performance over time

## Consequences
- **Improved Quality**: Fewer bugs in production
- **Faster Development**: Quick feedback loops
- **Higher Confidence**: Safe deployments
- **Technical Debt**: Requires maintenance
- **Initial Investment**: Setup time required

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up test infrastructure
2. Implement test patterns and utilities
3. Add tests for critical paths
4. Enforce quality gates in CI/CD
5. Monitor and improve test effectiveness

## Monitoring and Metrics
- Test execution time
- Flaky test rate
- Code coverage trends
- Test failure analysis
- Time to fix failing tests
