## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


AutoPR implements an AI-powered code review and enhancement system with four core business domains:

1. AI Linting & Code Analysis
- Specialized AI agents analyze and fix code quality issues using multi-agent orchestration
- Custom confidence scoring and issue prioritization system
