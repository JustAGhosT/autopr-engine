## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The AutoPR Engine implements a multi-faceted automated code review and quality management system with several key business domains:

## 1. Core Implementation Architecture

Primary implementation phase management system divided into three tiers:
- Immediate (10 days): Core monitoring and resilience systems 
- Medium (25 days): Integration and routing capabilities
- Strategic (45 days): Advanced AI features and fine-tuning

Key components:
- Phase dependency validation
- Success criteria tracking per phase
- Resource allocation controls
- Risk assessment scoring

File: `autopr/ai/implementation_roadmap.py`

## 2. Quality Analysis Pipeline

Multi-mode quality assessment system:
- Fast Mode: Basic linting and formatting
- Comprehensive Mode: Full static analysis
- AI-Enhanced Mode: ML-powered review
- Smart Mode: Context-aware tool selection

Quality scoring system weights:
- Fix success rate (25%)
- User satisfaction (20%) 
- Test pass rate (15%)
- Security score (10%)

File: `autopr/quality/metrics_collector.py`

## 3. AI Agent Management
Specialized agents for different review types:
- Code Analyzer: Issue detection and classification
- Code Fixer: Solution generation
- Quality Reviewer: Change validation
- Security Auditor: Security analysis
- Project Manager: Decision coordination

Agent selection based on:
- Issue type matching
- Historical performance
- Domain expertise
- Confidence scoring

File: `autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/agents.py`

## 4. Authorization Framework 
Multi-tiered permission system:
- Admin: Full system access
- Maintainer: Elevated access with delete rights
- Developer: Standard read/write access
- Viewer: Read-only capabilities

Resource-specific controls for:
- Projects
- Repositories
- Workflows
- Templates
- Organizations

File: `autopr/security/authorization/enterprise_manager.py`

## 5. Platform Detection System
Intelligent platform identification using:
- File signature analysis
- Dependency scanning
- Project structure evaluation
- Configuration pattern matching

Supports detection of:
- Development environments
- Deployment platforms
- Testing frameworks
- CI/CD systems

File: `autopr/actions/platform_detector.py`

The system emphasizes automated code quality management through AI-powered review and standardized quality gates while maintaining strict security controls and platform awareness.
