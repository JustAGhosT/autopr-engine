Core AI Analysis Components:

1. PR Review Analysis Engine
- Multi-tier classification system for PR content:
  * Feature changes (40% weight)
  * Bug fixes (30% weight)
  * Documentation (15% weight)
  * Configuration (15% weight)
- Pattern recognition for code changes with specialized detectors
- Learning system that maintains historical fix patterns
- File: `autopr/actions/pr_review_analyzer.py`

2. Pattern Recognition System
- Project-specific coding pattern detection
- Success rate tracking for different fix types
- Adaptive confidence scoring based on historical success
- File: `autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/detection.py`

3. Memory Integration
- Project-specific knowledge base maintenance
- Historical context retention for successful fixes
- User preference tracking and adaptation
- Files: 
  * `autopr/actions/learning_memory_system.py`
  * `autopr/actions/mem0_memory_integration.py`

4. Multi-Agent Coordination
- Specialized agents for different code analysis tasks
- Agent selection based on issue type and confidence
- Inter-agent communication protocols for complex fixes
- File: `autopr/actions/autogen_multi_agent.py`

5. Issue Classification Engine
- Severity-based issue categorization (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Fix priority calculation using weighted factors:
  * Issue severity (40%)
  * Historical success rate (30%)
  * Code complexity (20%)
  * Resource requirements (10%)
- File: `autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/ai_linting_fixer.py`

6. AI Provider Management
- Load balancing across multiple AI providers
- Provider-specific optimization for different analysis tasks
- Failover handling with provider-specific retry policies
- File: `autopr/ai/providers/manager.py`

The system implements a comprehensive AI-powered code analysis framework with specialized components for PR review, pattern detection, and continuous learning. The architecture emphasizes maintainable code quality through automated analysis and intelligent fix generation.
