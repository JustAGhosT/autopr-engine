# ai-analysis-algorithms

The core AI analysis algorithms consist of several key components:

## Comment Analysis System (Importance: 95)
Location: `autopr/actions/ai_comment_analyzer.py`

- Specialized PR comment analysis with domain-specific intents:
  - Comment classification: fix_request, question, suggestion, praise, complex_issue
  - Auto-fixability determination
  - Priority and tag assignment based on context
  - Contextual response template generation
- Custom fallback analysis with business-specific classification rules

## Memory & Learning System (Importance: 92)
Location: `autopr/actions/learning_memory_system.py` 

- Fix pattern recording and success rate tracking
- User preference learning with confidence scoring
- Project pattern analysis:
  - Coding style detection 
  - Naming convention analysis
  - File structure learning
- Recommendation generation based on historical patterns

## Multi-Agent Development System (Importance: 90)
Location: `autopr/actions/autogen_implementation.py`

- Role-based agent collaboration:
  - Software Architect: System design and planning
  - Senior Developer: Implementation and quality
  - Security Auditor: Vulnerability assessment  
  - QA Engineer: Test strategy
  - Code Reviewer: Standards enforcement
- Domain-specific quality scoring evaluating:
  - Implementation plan completeness
  - TypeScript type usage
  - Documentation quality
  - Test coverage
  - Inter-agent collaboration

## LLM Provider Management (Importance: 88)
Location: `autopr/ai/providers/manager.py`

- Dynamic provider selection and routing
- Fallback chain management
- Provider health monitoring
- Usage optimization across providers
- Context-aware provider selection based on:
  - Task complexity
  - Response time requirements
  - Cost constraints
  - Historical performance

## Platform Analysis System (Importance: 85)
Location: `autopr/actions/platform_detection/scoring.py`

- Multi-factor platform detection:
  - File signatures 
  - Dependency patterns
  - Commit message analysis
  - Folder structure evaluation
- Weighted scoring algorithm for platform confidence
- Migration opportunity identification
- Integration pattern detection
