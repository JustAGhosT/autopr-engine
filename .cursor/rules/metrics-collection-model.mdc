Core Metrics Collection Components:

1. Performance Tracking System (autopr/quality/metrics_collector.py):
- Custom weighted scoring system combining:
  - Fix success rate (25% weight)
  - User satisfaction (20% weight) 
  - Uptime (15% weight)
  - Test pass rate (15% weight)
  - Security and code quality (10% each)
  - Error rate (-5% penalty)
- Domain-specific trend analysis with thresholds:
  - "improving" for >5% positive change
  - "declining" for >5% negative change
  - "stable" for changes within Â±5%

2. Template Quality Metrics (autopr/quality/template_metrics/):
- Category-based quality scoring with weighted components:
  - Security: 2.5x multiplier
  - Structure: 2.0x multiplier 
  - Metadata: 1.5x multiplier
  - Variables: 1.2x multiplier
  - Documentation/Examples: 1.0x multiplier
- Critical issue penalty system that reduces scores based on severity
- Quality grading thresholds:
  - A: >= 90
  - B: >= 80 
  - C: >= 70
  - D: >= 60
  - F: < 60

3. AI Operation Metrics (autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/metrics.py):
- Specialized tracking for AI code fixes:
  - Success/failure rates per issue type
  - AI model confidence scoring
  - Token usage optimization
  - Processing duration tracking
  - Resource efficiency monitoring
- Custom KPI calculations:
  - Fix acceptance rate
  - Parallel processing efficiency
  - AI response quality metrics

4. Integration Performance Tracking:
- Cross-platform metrics collection from:
  - GitHub API response times
  - LLM provider latency
  - Database operation timing
  - Queue processing metrics
- Health score aggregation with weighted components focusing on system reliability and performance

The metrics collection system provides comprehensive monitoring across multiple aspects of the AutoPR system, with specialized tracking for AI operations, code quality, and system health.
