Core Metrics Collection System:

1. Success Rate Tracking
- Custom weighted metric calculation incorporating:
  * Fix success rate (25%)
  * User satisfaction (20%)
  * Uptime metrics (15%)
  * Test pass rates (15%) 
  * Code quality scores (10%)
  * Security metrics (10%)
  * Error rates (-5% penalty)

2. Performance Analytics Framework
- Specialized measurement system for:
  * Response timing per model/provider
  * Token usage efficiency 
  * CPU/Memory consumption patterns
  * API cost optimization tracking
  * Queue processing efficiency

3. Quality Assessment Pipeline
- Domain-specific quality metrics:
  * Code fix accuracy scores
  * Documentation coverage rates
  * Test coverage measurements
  * Security compliance checks
  * Performance impact analysis

4. Trend Analysis System
- Custom trend classification logic:
  * "improving": >5% positive change
  * "declining": >5% negative change
  * "stable": changes within Â±5%
  * Uses 7-day moving averages

5. Automated Recommendation Engine
- Context-aware suggestions based on:
  * Fix success rate thresholds (<80%)
  * User satisfaction scores (<3.5/5)
  * Response time metrics (>5s)
  * Error frequency patterns (>10%)

Core Implementation Files:
- autopr/evaluation/metrics_collector.py
- autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/metrics.py
- autopr/quality/metrics_collector.py

The system uniquely combines AI performance metrics with code quality measurements to provide comprehensive insights into automated PR management effectiveness.

Importance Score: 95 - Critical for measuring and optimizing core business operations
