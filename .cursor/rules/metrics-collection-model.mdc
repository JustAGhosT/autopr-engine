# metrics-collection-model

The metrics collection system implements a comprehensive framework for measuring and analyzing AutoPR's performance across multiple dimensions:

## Core Metrics Framework

### Evaluation Categories (90)
- Fix Success Rate (25% weight)
- User Satisfaction (20% weight) 
- System Uptime (15% weight)
- Test Pass Rates (15% weight)
- Security Score (10% weight)
- Code Quality (10% weight)
- Error Rate (-5% negative weight)

### Success Rate Calculations (85)
- Automated fix acceptance rate
- PR review success percentage
- Classification accuracy for issues
- False positive detection rate
- API cost optimization tracking

### Quality Scoring (80)
- Code quality measurements
- Security vulnerability detection
- Test coverage analysis
- Documentation completeness
- Coding standards compliance

### Performance Monitoring (75)
- Response time tracking
- API latency measurements
- Resource utilization
- Rate limit monitoring
- Cost per operation

### Trend Analysis (70)
- Weekly moving averages
- Success rate trends (+/- 5%)
- User satisfaction trends
- Error rate patterns
- Cost optimization trends
