# data-flow-integration

The system implements several key data flow integration patterns:

1. AI Linting Data Flow (autopr/actions/ai_linting_fixer/orchestration.py)
- Orchestrates data flow between detection, analysis and fix application stages
- Custom issue queue management with Redis backend
- Prioritized processing pipeline with configurable thresholds
- Data transformations between LLM responses and code fixes

2. Cross-Platform Issue Synchronization (autopr/actions/multi_platform_integrator.py)
- Manages bi-directional data flow between GitHub, Linear, and Slack
- Platform-specific data transformations:
  * GitHub PR -> Linear issue 
  * GitHub PR -> Slack message
  * Linear issue -> GitHub comment
- Maintains data consistency through synchronization IDs

3. Memory Integration System (autopr/actions/learning_memory_system.py)
- Implements pattern recognition data flow for code fixes
- Stores and retrieves fix patterns with success metrics
- User preference learning through interaction history
- Project context analysis with pattern matching

4. Quality Data Pipeline (autopr/quality/metrics_collector.py)
- Aggregates quality metrics from multiple tools
- Standardizes data format across different quality checks
- Maintains historical quality trends
- Generates consolidated quality reports

5. Authorization Data Flow (autopr/security/authorization/audited_manager.py)
- Tracks permission changes across system components
- Maintains audit trail of authorization decisions
- Implements role-based access control data flow
- Caches authorization decisions with automated invalidation

The core integration logic focuses on maintaining data consistency and proper transformations between different platforms while preserving context and relationships. The system emphasizes reliable data flow through queueing, caching, and synchronization mechanisms.
