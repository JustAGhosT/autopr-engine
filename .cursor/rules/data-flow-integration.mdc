## Core Data Flow Components

### 1. LLM Provider Integration (90)
- Location: `autopr/ai/providers/manager.py`
- Orchestrates data flow between different LLM providers:
  - Routes requests through selected provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, etc)
  - Handles response streaming and completion generation
  - Manages fallback behavior between providers
  - Synchronizes provider health status and availability

### 2. Platform Integration Bridge (85) 
- Location: `autopr/integrations/base.py`
- Manages bi-directional data flow between:
  - GitHub PR events/comments
  - Linear issue tracking
  - Slack notifications via Axolo
  - Error tracking systems
- Implements synchronization logic to maintain consistency across platforms

### 3. Memory & Learning System (80)
- Location: `autopr/actions/learning_memory_system.py`
- Handles data persistence and retrieval for:
  - Fix pattern learning from successful PR fixes
  - User preference tracking
  - Project pattern analysis
  - Integration with provider-specific storage

### 4. Workflow Engine (75)
- Location: `autopr/workflows/engine.py`
- Orchestrates data flow through workflow steps:
  - Routes events to appropriate handlers
  - Manages workflow state transitions
  - Synchronizes data between workflow stages
  - Handles parallel workflow execution

### 5. Cross-Platform Synchronization (70)
- Location: `autopr/actions/multi_platform_integrator.py`
- Maintains data consistency across:
  - Issue tracking systems (GitHub/Linear/Jira)
  - Communication platforms (Slack/Discord/Teams)
  - Documentation systems (Notion)
- Implements custom sync strategies per platform

### 6. AI Multi-Agent Coordination (70)
- Location: `autopr/actions/autogen_multi_agent.py`
- Manages data flow between specialized AI agents:
  - Code Analyzer
  - Code Fixer
  - Quality Reviewer
  - Security Auditor
  - Project Manager
- Coordinates inter-agent communication and data sharing
