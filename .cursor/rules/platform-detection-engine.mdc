# platform-detection-engine

The platform detection system implements intelligent analysis and classification of development platforms through multi-factor scoring and recommendation generation.

## Core Components

### Platform Scoring Engine (90/100)
File: `autopr/actions/platform_detection/scoring.py`

Calculates weighted confidence scores across multiple indicators:
- File signatures (0.4 weight)
- Dependencies (0.25 weight) 
- Folder patterns (0.2 weight)
- Commit patterns (0.15 weight)
- Content matches (0.1 weight)

Implements score normalization and platform ranking to determine:
- Primary platform (highest confidence)
- Secondary platforms (>0.3 confidence)
- Workflow type (single/hybrid/multi-platform)

### Platform Analysis Engine (85/100)
File: `autopr/actions/platform_detection/detector.py`

Performs deep analysis of project characteristics:
- Runtime environment detection
- Database technology identification  
- Framework pattern matching
- TypeScript/JavaScript analysis
- Project structure validation

### Enhancement Recommendations (80/100)
File: `autopr/actions/platform_detector.py`

Generates platform-specific enhancement recommendations:
- Missing configurations
- Security improvements
- Testing setup
- Production readiness
- Framework integrations

### Migration Analysis (75/100)
File: `autopr/actions/platform_detection/file_analyzer.py`

Evaluates migration opportunities:
- Cross-platform compatibility scoring
- Technology stack alignment
- Migration complexity assessment
- Benefit analysis
- Step-by-step migration paths

## Platform Support

Detects and analyzes platforms including:
- Replit
- Lovable
- Bolt
- Same
- Emergent

For each platform, maintains fingerprints of:
- Required files
- Dependency patterns 
- Folder structures
- Configuration formats
- Framework indicators
