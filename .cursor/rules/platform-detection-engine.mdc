The platform detection engine implements a sophisticated multi-signal analysis system for identifying and classifying development platforms and frameworks.

Core Components:

1. Platform Scoring System
- Weighted scoring algorithm evaluating multiple signals:
  * File patterns (0.4 weight)
  * Dependencies (0.25 weight) 
  * Folder structures (0.2 weight)
  * Content patterns (0.1 weight)
  * Script signatures (0.05 weight)

2. Platform Registry
- Comprehensive catalog of supported platforms:
  * Replit: Cloud development environment
  * Lovable.dev: React prototyping platform
  * Bolt.new: Full-stack web framework
  * Same.new: Component library platform
  * Emergent.sh: AI-assisted development

3. Detection Rules Engine
- Platform-specific detection patterns:
  * Framework-specific file markers
  * Required dependency sets
  * Configuration file templates
  * Directory structure requirements
  * Unique platform signatures

4. Confidence Scoring
- Multi-factor confidence calculation:
  * Signal strength evaluation
  * Pattern match quality
  * Context validation
  * Cross-signal correlation

5. Migration Analysis
- Platform compatibility assessment
- Migration path identification
- Dependency conflict detection
- Configuration transformation mapping
