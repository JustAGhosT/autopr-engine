# platform-detection-engine

The platform detection engine implements specialized logic for identifying and analyzing development platforms and frameworks used in codebases.

Core Components:

1. Platform Detection Algorithm (Importance: 95)
- Multi-factor weighted scoring system using:
  * File signatures (40% weight)
  * Dependencies (25% weight)
  * Folder patterns (20% weight)
  * Commit messages (15% weight)
  * Content patterns (10% weight)
- Confidence threshold system:
  * High confidence: >0.8 score
  * Medium confidence: 0.5-0.8 score 
  * Low confidence: <0.5 score

2. Platform Classification (Importance: 90)
- Workflow type categorization:
  * Single platform (1 high confidence match)
  * Hybrid workflow (1+ high + 1+ medium confidence)
  * Multi-platform (2+ high/medium confidence)
- Platform-specific configuration extraction:
  * Replit: Runtime detection, config parsing
  * Lovable: Framework and TypeScript detection
  * Bolt: Database type detection
  * Same.new: Fullstack analysis
  * Emergent.sh: Platform services detection

3. Enhancement Analysis (Importance: 85)
- Generates platform-specific enhancement recommendations:
  * Production readiness requirements
  * Testing infrastructure needs
  * Security hardening recommendations
- Maps enhancement packages by category:
  * Security
  * Performance
  * Monitoring
  * Testing
  * Development

Key Business Rules:
- Platform detection requires minimum 0.5 confidence score
- Enhancement recommendations must match detected platform capabilities
- Platform combinations validated for compatibility
- Migration path analysis required for hybrid/multi-platform setups
