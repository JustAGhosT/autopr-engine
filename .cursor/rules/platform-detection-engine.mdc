# platform-detection-engine

The platform detection engine consists of three core components:

## Platform Detection Algorithm (Importance: 95)
File: `/autopr/actions/platform_detector.py`

Detection system identifies development platforms through:
- Signature matching against known platform-specific files
- Analysis of dependency patterns in package manifests  
- Project structure fingerprinting
- Configuration file pattern recognition
- Commit message analysis

The detection process generates a confidence score for each potential platform match using:
- Number of matched signatures
- Strength of dependency correlations
- Structure similarity scores
- Configuration completeness metrics

## Enhancement Recommendations (Importance: 85)
File: `/autopr/actions/prototype_enhancer.py`

Once a platform is detected, the enhancer:
1. Generates platform-optimized recommendations for:
   - Required dependencies
   - Recommended project structure
   - Platform-specific best practices
   - Missing configuration files
2. Provides implementation templates for:
   - Common platform patterns
   - Integration points
   - Development workflows

## Multi-Platform Integration (Importance: 80) 
File: `/autopr/actions/multi_platform_integrator.py`

Handles cross-platform compatibility:
- Maps detected platform features to universal capabilities
- Identifies integration points between platforms
- Manages platform-specific requirements
- Generates compatibility matrices
- Provides migration paths between platforms
