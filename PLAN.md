# AutoPR Engine: Memo0-Enabled Multi-Tenant Agent Orchestration Platform

## Project Overview

AutoPR Engine is being transformed into a multi-tenant, enterprise-grade agent orchestration platform that enables SaaS providers and enterprises to deploy, manage, and monitor AI agents at scale. The platform supports hybrid agent frameworks, robust observability, and cost optimization.

## Business Goals

### High-Level Objectives
- Achieve 99.99% platform uptime for all tenants within 6 months
- Support 5+ major agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, Semantic Kernel) by Q3
- Onboard 10+ enterprise tenants in Q1 post-launch
- Reduce per-agent operational costs by 30% vs single-tenant solutions
- Ensure SOC2 and GDPR compliance for all tenant data

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Agent Orchestration Layer**
   - Multi-tenant agent lifecycle management
   - Framework-agnostic agent deployment
   - Intelligent request routing

2. **Memory & Data Layer**
   - Memo0 integration for multi-tenant memory
   - Vector database abstraction
   - Tenant isolation and data encryption

3. **Observability & Management**
   - Real-time metrics and logging
   - Tenant-aware monitoring
   - Cost optimization and quota management
